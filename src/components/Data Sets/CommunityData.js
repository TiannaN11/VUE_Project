        notes: "Oh my, what can I say about my return to the fictional village of Faha, in December 1962. Niall Williams’ previous book about the Irish village of Faha was This Is Happiness. While embracing the advent season, this beautiful book, Time of the Child, was a perfect book to ground me in values and faith in this Christmas season. Niall Williams is a treasure with his luminous and beautiful prose and truly one of our greatest storytellers. I cannot imagine anything better than being lost in the beautiful and poignant prose of Niall Williams in Ireland.\n" +

            "“For children, childhood is timeless. It is always the present. Everything is in the present tense. Of course, they have memories. Of course, time shifts a little for them and Christmas comes round in the end. But they don’t feel it. Today is what they feel, and when they say ‘When I grow up,’ there is always an edge of disbelief—how could they ever be other than who they are?\n" +
            "\n" +
            "In this Advent season in Faha, as the town readies itself for Christmas, Doctor Jack Troy and his daughter Veronica’s lives are upended as a child is left in their care. It is this child that alters life, not only in the life of the Troys, but in all of Faha as everyone is forced to examine their values in this iconic Irish village. The Midnight Mass was a beautiful part of the book that struck every part of my heart. And the ensuing words will move you, especially in this Christmas season. Happy Holidays to all in this joyous season."

        notes: "This book was fine. It was a very quick read, but I wouldn’t call it a page turner. I could see where the plot was trying to go, but it felt to me as though the author held back a bit when writing this (almost like the characters held back when writing!) and there wasn’t a sense of suspense. While I was interested in the story, nothing about it really spoke out to me, shocked me or gave me a thrill. These characters could really have been stretched, but again, something felt held back. I’ve seen some really good reviews for this one, but it just didn’t work for me. Three stars."

        rating: "4 out of 5 stars",
        notes: "Author lightly touches on topics important to society as of the time it was written, and though it was published this year, it's hard for me to imagine we still care about these matters when the 2024 election results say differently. Maybe this book was written for me, in this sense, because I'm experiencing pain, betrayal, shock, and so much more still and probably will continue to do so for many years to come. Forgiveness is an ongoing process, just like grief - I mean, after my parents died, I didn't only grieve for an acceptable set period, but I grieve every day, even if that grief looks different and feels different every day. It doesn't always hurt, but my longing for them is ever present. In that same vein of preserving relationships and grieving the past while trying to strengthen the future, I am trying hard to forgive the people in my life that I still want to love and respect but who voted MAGA. I'm still trying to find a way to stay connected to them, because their vote isn't all who they are. I'm still trying to remember why were friends in the first place.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "What zinged me the most was the quote from Richard Rohr about how if we don't transform our pain, we end up transmitting it. I guess that's a different way of saying how hurt people, hurt people. Now I have to ask myself how I will end up transforming my pain so that I avoid transmitting it. How do I find peace rather than let the chaos in my heart spill out. I'm working it out in therapy, but my goodness, it still sucks major rotten eggs!"
